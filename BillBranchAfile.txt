So from here i have removed the other 3 branches thru my windows git which im using cause its easier.
Ive deleted them thru github after syncing them up first.
Follow that i have repulled the master then made this new billbranchA local rep.
Created this file and will then commit and push it back up to the main.
Let the master commit the changes and i should then be ok.
